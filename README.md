## Description

This is an overview of linear algebra fundamentals which focuses on providing an intuitive / geometric review of some of the main concepts.

I was trying to find a readable overview presented in the same style as [3Blue1Brown's lectures on the essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab), and didn't have much luck finding many, so this overview is my attempt at providing one.

It contains:

- A basic review of linear algebra fundamentals.
- Some of the important applications of linear algebra which includes an overview of how it can be used to model and solve systems of linear equations, as well as some examples showing how it's used in the real world.

This is by no means my own work, as I've taken my favourite review material and simply compiled it in what I believe is a more readable format. Full credit for all of the material goes to the content creators I've listed in the Credits section.
